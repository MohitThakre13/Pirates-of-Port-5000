            16th September
By the time he reached there, journalists had swarmed outside the entrance. As he and his team shouldered their way through the crowd into the building, he realized that he had a strange feeling in the pit of his stomach. Anxiety? No, I must not be nervous now, everything we’ve done so far is at stake. He took a few deep breaths and began to climb the stairs to the third floor.  He spied Inspector Shukla out of the corner of his eye. A few other members of the forensic team had gathered outside the door. Soon enough the forensic team was let inside. The body had been removed, but there were a few bloodstains on the wall facing the window. The other members of his team immediately went to their work, but he had something else on his mind. Clues, he must have left some clues. He callously glanced around himself to find something which might give him a hint where the money was hidden. His eyes went towards the table which was kept just beneath the window. It was a mahogany table with a beautiful design engraved on it. But that wasn’t the reason this table had caught his eye. The table had some objects on it which one doesn’t usually see together. As he peered upon these objects, he wondered if they could be the clue. There was a deck of cards, it wasn’t neatly stacked, several cards on the top had escaped the deck, probably because of the wind, and were strewn across the table next to each other. These were the king of clubs, the queen of clubs, the ace of hearts, the ace of spades and the tenth of diamonds. On the right side of the table was a bowl of rice with a pair of chopsticks. The chopsticks made a V shape with each other and were thrust into the rice in the same fashion as flags are thrust into the ground. He shifted his gaze to the third object on the table, a radio. It was of an old make; it had a dial which controlled a needle inside and this needle was resting against the 91.9th mark.

Is this the hint he left me? Or am I mistaking some random objects to be the clue? As these thoughts floated about in his head, his eyes stared blankly at the objects in front of him. And then suddenly he saw it. 

No radio channel airs at 91.9 Mega Hertz.

It felt like cold water was flowing out of the centre of his brain and filling his head with a solemn calmness. He had succeeded in the first part, identifying the hints, but the task of finding out what information did the hints convey was still at hand. 

As the forensic team moved out of the room, Inspector Shukla beckoned him towards himself.
“Neeraj, surely, I am not the only one who thinks there’s something fishy with the table. Eh, what do you think?”
NO, he must not find out
 “Why sir? I feel everything’s normal about it….”
“Oh”, he said cutting Neeraj in between.
“It’s okay, I didn’t expect you to see the anomaly anyway, after all, you aren’t an Inspector now, are you? Hehe”
“I don’t get your point sir.”
“Neeraj, my friend, let me tell you, 91.9 is not a radio channel. I sense something fishy going on here. Never mind we’ll find out about it.”


9th September
Mr. Barua stepped out of his car and took the umbrella handed to him by a servant. Today he wasn’t wearing his routine garments, which were very expensive and often imported. Today he was dressed like a simple man, plain trousers and a shirt. He walked towards the tin shade stall at the roadside looking straight ahead. Something about his eyes made him look almost lifeless, there were dark circles beneath them and it looked like all happiness had been sucked out of him. He reached the stall and bought a cigarette. His eyes studied the road keenly, looking for someone. He had to buy another cigarette before the person he had been waiting for turned up. 

This second person was wearing plain garb as well. Good, had he worn his uniform, it would’ve been difficult to talk to him in public. He patiently waited for the second person to finish his tea and then as soon as he got up, Mr. Barua laid a hand on his shoulder and said, “Akshay, can we talk in private?” Mr. Barua saw a glimmer of recognition in Akshay’s eye as he turned to see him.
“Mr. Barua….uh…..”
“Yes, it’s me.”
“I am so sorry for your loss. Please tell me what can I do for you.”
“Words won’t bring back my son Akshay.”
“Mr. Barua……”
“I know you are innocent.”
He took a long pause and said,
“My son died in police custody, for a crime he didn’t even commit.”
His eyes, which had been dry a moment ago, filled with tears.
“Mr. Barua, I can only offer my consolation.”
“Consolation is not what I want, I seek redemption.” It felt that he was having difficulty in getting these words out. His throat felt a little dry now and he sobbed after every word or two.
“You saw it Akshay, you saw it, how the Commissioner let all this happen.”
Akshay had no response for this.
“Akshay, I know your family condition isn’t great, and your meagre salary can’t help you uphold all the responsibilities you have.”
This caught Akshay off guard, for he had kept this fact strictly secret, letting only his closest friends know. But Mr. Barua was a wealthy man, he owned several clubs in Dispur, he had ways of finding out things people didn’t want found out. 
“I could give you 50 lakh Rupees if you assassinate Commissioner Chopra.”


10th September
It wasn’t difficult to convince Neeraj. He was motivated not only by his fragile economic condition, but also by his hatred for Commissioner Chopra, who had once slapped him in front of the entire office. 
With Commissioner Chopra being surrounded by security most of the time, this assassination was not going to be easy, which is why Akshay had sought the help of his best friend Neeraj, who was a forensic photographer. They had planned to kill him using poison, but smuggling that poison into his food, that, was going to be a big problem. 

They continued their planning for a few days, but they couldn't reach upon a full proof plan.
15th September
It was a cold night. Akshay had just had a heavy dinner. There was a forest just behind the apartments in which he lived, where he often went for walks. That night too, he ventured out for one. His mind was preoccupied with the possible plans for killing Chopra. He was strolling at a leisurely pace, enjoying the cool atmosphere which the forest provided, when he heard a voice. A rather very raspy one. For one moment, Akshay couldn’t believe his ears. He took a deep breath and heard it again. Yes, it was him, it was unmistakably Commissioner Chopra’s voice. He crouched and inched towards the source of the sound. He saw Chopra through a thicket. He seemed to be alone. Akshay’s mind began to race. This could be the perfect chance of assassinating Chopra, the plan of poisoning him seemed too far fetched anyway. 
He picked up a rock which lay nearby, grabbed it with both his hands, and lunged towards Chopra. He put his left hand on Chopra’s face so that his scream would be muffled and with the other, he gave his head the strongest blow he could. Within moments, Chopra was dead. 
As Akshay let go of Chopra, he heard another voice, “Sirrr, where did you goo, sir where are you??” Akshay recognised this person immediately. It Inspector Shukla, Chopra’s biggest sycophant. 
Akshay began to leave that place as quietly as he could, using the moonlight to avoid placing his feet on dried twigs and leaves. As he was weaving his way through the thick forest undergrowth, he heard a shout which froze his blood.
“Oiii, who’s there?”
Akshay had no time to think, he began running back towards his house as fast as his legs would let him. He heard the sound of a gunshot. He swerved to the left to avoid another bullet. Akshay knew how to lose Shukla in the woods; he had been coming here for the last 5 years every day, but this was probably Shukla’s first time. 
Soon enough, he had left Shukla behind. He arrived at the apartment building not long after and rushed to his floor. 
“There is no way I can hide here forever; the apartment lights can be seen from afar. If I am lucky, I may get ten more minutes to live.”
Beads of perspiration formed upon his brow. The only sensible option now was to somehow tell the location of the bag of money to Neeraj. He couldn’t call Neeraj, because he knew that his call history will be searched after his death. There has to be a way, oh lord, there has to be a way. If I can’t have it, then I must give the club owner’s money to Neeraj somehow……hay….club owner…….club owner. He took out a deck of cards from a cabinet and set to work.

17th September
Neeraj stared at the pictures he had taken blankly. A few cards, a bowl of rice with chopsticks in it, and a radio. What could this possibly mean? What had Akshay thought of in the last few minutes of his life that he had set these things in such a bizarre manner. The police will soon trace the murder to me, I must find out where is the club owner’s money before that happens…..heyy.….club owner……club……King of clubs. 

He had cracked it.

Okay, so Mr. Barua owns many clubs, but here he has put the king of clubs and the queen of clubs……The King and Queen Club! The tenth of diamonds would probably refer to the money, the ace of spades……hmmmm……could ace mean one?.......yes. So, I’d have to use a spade to dig out the money. Very well, but what does this ace of hearts represent? Hearts? What could it possibly mean? Loved ones? No?.....Heart……is in your chest….oh a chestnut tree……yes there is an orchard behind the King and Queen Club. So the money is beneath this Chestnut tree.

Elated with this finding, he then concentrated on the radio. 

So, if the cards gave the location, the radio and the bowl must give the date and time ? The radio showed 91.9, if I reverse it, I’ll get 9:19, no, the club opens at 10pm. What if the radio is meant for the date? 91.9……..It is September, so that is represented by 9, 19 is that the date? Yes, 19th of September!

Now only the bowl of rice with the chopsticks in it remained.

Now this obviously tells the time…….ah yes, the two chopsticks are like the two hands of a clock. 
He stared at the chopsticks for a moment. He took out a protractor and measured the angle between them. It was roughly sixty degrees. 
A sixty degrees angle……...oh I get it, it could be 1:55, no that would become 20th September.
11:05, yes.

And finally, all the information was with him.
11:05 pm on 19th September, below the Chestnut tree behind the King and Queen club.

He dreamt about Akshay that night, feasting and singing with his family while playing a game of cards.
