        <p class="content"><br><br>Women’s status and contribution to ancient Chinese society are recognized in the
            principle of yin and yang. The male(yang) is deemed dominant and superior to the female (Yin), who tends to
            be more submissive. Many traditional female characters in literature have stated that they had been a man in
            their previous lives but had been reincarnated as a woman due to past sins. The phrase “men plow, women
            weave” describes the strict division between the sexes. Women were, thus, expected to be educated on
            specific “women’s rites, etiquettes, and duties,” including many excruciating and restricting practices.
            Endeavoring through this male-dominated society, many women rose to live extraordinary lives, producing
            great literature and scholarship and ruling the Chinese empire.<br><br>
            Modern historians and observers criticize Confucianism for creating a patriarchy that oppressed women. Yet,
            they had very different experiences depending on the time, place, ethnic group, and social class in which
            they were born. During the Tang dynasty, women’s status was uplifted but declined from the Song dynasty
            onward because of the rise of neo-Confucianism.<br>
            Women were the first subordinate to their fathers, then their husbands, and finally, in case of the death of
            their husbands, their sons. Such a system is known as” three following” or sancong. They were other
            physically ill-treated, socially disapproved, and forced to compete for their husband's affections with
            concubines; a woman's place was unenviable. Thus, everyone in China knew it was more fortunate to be born a
            male or have a male child. He would grow up to contribute financially and perpetuate the family name; On the
            other hand, women had no means to earn money or own property and would leave their families and join their
            husbands.
            Women were expected to excel in four areas: fidelity, cautious speech, industriousness, and graceful
            manners. <br>A woman's virtue was a particularly valued attribute in Chinese society. Upper-class women who
            lived during the Ming and Qing dynasties cultivated their skills in writing, needlework, poetry, and music,
            many becoming highly accomplished in these arts of the domestic sphere.
            Confucius probably took for granted the loyalty, courage, and devotion, but also intrigue, manipulation, and
            selfishness common in his society. He placed a high value on family traditions and associated values like
            filial piety. Through ritual practise, he believed that everyone—men and women, rich and poor, young and
            old—would learn to perform the responsibilities of their roles. One important first step toward ensuring
            that yin would not rule yang was maintaining a physical boundary between the worlds of men and women.
            According to the Confucian classic Book of Rites, segregation is crucial in the household. Houses should be
            split into an inner and an outer sector, with the women living in the inner section.
            Now let us look into the details of the conditions of women in different ancient and imperial eras of China.
